# Hi, I’m Manuel! 👋


I am a Frontend-Leaning Full Stack Developer that loves to build things that are interactive, educational, and pretty 😊

After a long stay in Theory land (CS PhD - UC Berkeley in Complexity Theory), I’ve had a hankering to build more things and I am now at the the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) coding things into existence with a great community, and I'm looking for **a job** to do more of the same!

My favorite projects combine my love for design and education with my theory background, making it particularly fun to code Music Software, Digital Signal Processing, and Photo Processing tools! In general I like making tools and products that people will actively use and find intuitive and easeful.

I'm also particularly excited for platform technology, where my users will be other software devs and colleagues. Building tools for people I know and whose use cases are similar to mine is incredibly rewarding!

- 🛠️ : Follow my progress on [waveformr](https://github.com/msabin/waveformr), where I spend some time at the Recurse Center building a digital oscillator for a waveform you draw by hand!
