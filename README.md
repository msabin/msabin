# Hi, I’m Manuel! 👋


I am a Frontend-Leaning Full Stack Developer that loves to build things that are interactive, educational, and pretty 😊

After a long stay in Theory land (CS PhD, UC Berkeley in Computational Complexity Theory), I’ve had a hankering to build more things and I am now at the the ~[Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) coding things into existence with a great community, and I'm looking for **a job** to do more of the same!

My favorite projects combine my love for design and education with my theory background, making it particularly fun to code Music Software, Digital Signal Processing, and Photo Processing tools!

- Check out my [music toy](https://github.com/msabin/rhythmonics) visualizing the relationship between harmony and polyrhythms! 🎵
- Follow my progress at the Recurse Center on [waveformr](https://github.com/msabin/waveformr), where I am building a digital oscillator for a waveform you draw by hand! 〰️
